MapReduce is the heart of Hadoop It is this programming paradigm that allows for massive scalability across hundreds
or thousands of servers in a Hadoop cluster. The MapReduce concept is fairly simple to understand for those who are
familiar with clustered scale-out data processing solutions For people new to this topic it can be somewhat difficult
to grasp because it is not typically something people have been exposed to previously. If you new to Hadoop MapReduce
jobs don not worry we going to describe it in a way that gets you up to speed quickly The term MapReduce actually refers
to two separate and distinct tasks that Hadoop programs perform. The first is the map job, which takes a set of data and
converts it into another set of data, where individual elements are broken down into tuples key/value pairs. The reduce
job takes the output from a map as input and combines those data tuples into a smaller set of tuples. As the sequence of
the name MapReduce implies the reduce job is always performed after the map job.
