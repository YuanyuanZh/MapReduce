I am a bit confused regarding data structure in python simple list probably since I cannot identify the
type of data I am failing to sort it words that start with an uppercase letter get preference over those
starting with a lowercase letter When failures occur in distributed system some system needs to reorganize to continue
operation This paper presents two election and reorganization algorithms for two failure environments Seven basic
assumptions all nodes cooperate software has no bug communications subsystems do not spontaneously generate messages
nodes have safe storage cells node halts when it fails no transmission error and messages are received same order as sent
In a system without communication failure and node pause, bully election algorithm is presented Basic idea is that node
with highest ID number is elected as coordinator to do the reorganization In a system with communication failure and node
pause
